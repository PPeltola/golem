# GOLEM

**_GOLEM_** (Gurps Online Lore & Explorer Manager) will hopefully be a tool for managing and creating new character sheets for _GURPS_ (the Generic Universal RolePlaying System). The goal of _GOLEM_ is to streamline the numbers part of the character building and developing process while keeping the ease of use of the regular paper sheets we all are familiar with.

Sorry for the slow progress, I just haven't had enough time :/
