# GOLEM

## What is the goal of GOLEM?

**_GOLEM_** (Gurps Online Lore & Explorer Manager) will in the future hopefully be a tool for managing and creating new character sheets for _GURPS_ (the Generic Universal RolePlaying System). The goal of _GOLEM_ is to streamline the numbers part of the character building and developing process while keeping the ease of use of the regular paper sheets we all are familiar with.

## The current state

At it's current state _GOLEM_ is a walking skeleton (adventurers beware!) of a campaign & character management system. The current build implements user registration & authentication, basic campaign creation & listing, basic character creation, listing, updating & deletion and available skill creation for admin users. The campaign & character management that the current buil implements is far from enough to be used in an actual campaign, but I atleast intend to develop the tool further on my spare time.

Sorry for the slow progress, I just haven't had enough time :/
