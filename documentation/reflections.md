# Reflections & limitations

## The goal & the results

At the moment the app is pretty much a walking skeleton of what it could be. The goal was to create a system where game masters could manage their campaigns and players theris characters. Of course the goal was a bit out of the scope of this course, since rpg characters, and especially GURPS characters, are quite complex: [Example character sheet](link). The original idea was for the skills to be linked many-to-many to the characters in the current build, but that turned out to be a bit more tricky than I had imagined. The functionality honestly leaves a lot to be desired, but I am happy that the existing functionality turned out fairly ok.

During the course I had time limitations and therefore couldn't develop the app as much as I would've liked, but I want to continue developing it further, since I am an aspiring GURPS game master myself, would like to have access to a system like the one GOLEM aims to be one day. The dream would be a working, intuitively laid out character sheet that is optimized for tablet use, since GURPS is such a numbers-heavy system that an online sheet that does some of the crunching for you would make the game more fun.

## What I've learned

At the start of the course I had never really developed stand-alone web applications or done much with python, so I learned a lot during it. I especially liked using Flask, which was quite easy to pick up and felt intuitive. The course got me more interested in web development and I think I will start the fullstack course next. I enjoyed the course even though I was not completely happy with my results.
